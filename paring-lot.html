<p class="col-md-8 fs-7"><strong>What techniques can support people as they learn how to listen to sounds analytically?</strong> I explore this question through video analysis of a live performance of <a href="https://switchedonpop.com/"><em>Switched on Pop</em></a>, a podcast that teaches people how to listen closely to music.</p>
<p class="col-md-8 fs-7"><em>Switched on Pop</em> takes the stance that pop music isn't just junk food for your ears; rather, it’s a powerful vehicle to understand musical concepts like song structure and chord progression.
On the podcast, they use a variety of techniques to teach sonic concepts, including: repetition with variation, defining key terms, and reproducing sounds with instruments or their own voices. These techniques might translate to teaching audiences to perceive auditory display and sonification, which, like music, uses the qualities sounds — timbre, tempo, pitch, etc. — to convey meaning.</p>
<p class="col-md-8 fs-7"><strong>Video analysis</strong> enables us to see what close listening looks like and observe how it happens in the whole body, rather than only in the ears and mind. Further, video analysis allows us to consider listening as a sensory-social experience by observing interpersonal acts of listening.
This is especially relevant for the live performance of <em>Switched on Pop</em>, where the hosts and audience can interact with each other.</p>
