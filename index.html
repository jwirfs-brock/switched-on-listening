    <p class="col-md-8 fs-5">This work analyzes video of a live performance of <em>Switched on Pop</em>, a podcast that teaches people how to listen closely to music—with the goal of understanding interactions that can help people learn to listen to sounds analytically.</p>

    <dt class="col-sm-3">Approach</dt>
    <dd class="col-sm-9">
      <p>I explore this question through video analysis of a live performance of <a href="https://switchedonpop.com/"><em>Switched on Pop</em></a>, a podcast that teaches people how to listen closely to pop music.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="col-sm-3">If my focus is sonification, why turn to pop music?</dt>
    <dd class="col-sm-9"><em>Switched on Pop</em> takes the stance that pop music isn't just junk food for your ears; rather, it’s a powerful vehicle to understand musical concepts like song structure and chord progression.
      On the podcast, they use a variety of techniques to teach sonic concepts, including: repetition with variation, defining key terms, and reproducing sounds with instruments or their own voices. These techniques might translate to teaching audiences to perceive auditory display and sonification, which, like music, uses the qualities sounds — timbre, tempo, pitch, etc. — to convey meaning.</dd>

    <dt class="col-sm-3 ">We are here to research sounds, so why look at video?</dt>
    <dd class="col-sm-9"><strong>Video analysis</strong> enables us to see what close listening looks like and observe how it happens in the whole body, rather than only in the ears and mind. <p>Further, video analysis allows us to consider listening as a sensory-social experience by observing interpersonal acts of listening.
    This is especially relevant for the live performance of <em>Switched on Pop</em>, where the hosts and audience can interact with each other.</p></dd>

  <h2 class="display-9 fw-bold col-md-8">The Video Clip</h2>
  <p class="fs-7">I analyzed an 80-second where the two podcast hosts, Charlie Harding and Nate Sloan,
  discuss the 2000 Britney Spears hit, "Oops!... I Did It Again,"</p>
  <p>The podcast hosts teach the live audience how the structure of the song, which has a two-part chorus, reflects the theme of the song, which is about grappling with multiple conflicting identities.
  First, everyone (hosts and audience) listen to an excerpt from the song. Then, Harding and Sloan lead a participatory activity: a two-part audience sing-a-long of the chorus.
Finally, Harding helps the audience interpret the song through explanatory and expository narrative. </p>
<p>Here's the clip:</p>

  <h2 class="display-9 fw-bold col-md-8">Methods: Video Analysis Through Creating Analytic Artifacts</h2>
<p>To perform video analysis, you watch the same clip repeatedly, each time viewing with a different lens.
  As you watch, you create a series of interpretive, analytic artifacts that abstract data from the clip [Barron & Engle 2007, Derry et al 2010], like an ethnographer taking detailed field notes.
</p>
<p>The analytic artifacts I created for this project include:</p>
<div class="container">
  <div class="row row-cols-2">
    <div class="col">Activity log</div>
    <div class="col">Playscript - a phonetic transcript</div>
    <div class="col">Play-by-play - descriptive play-by-play of the action</div>
    <div class="col">Landscape diagram</div>
    <div class="col">Scroll - A storyboard "scroll"</div>
    <div class="col">Vignette - An analytic vignette</div>
  </div>

<div class="container-fluid p-5 mb-4 rounded-1 ">
  <h2 class="display-9 fw-bold col-md-8">Key Findings</h2>
  <p>Focusing on video drew my attention to four themes: </p>
  <ul>
<li>the interplay between scripted and unscripted action,</li>
<li>how sequencing of interaction to support learning,</li>
<li>what close listening <em>looks</em>,</li>
<li>the role embodiment plays in how people make sense of sounds.</li>
</ul>

  <h4 class="display-9 fw-bold col-md-8">Scripted and Unscripted Action</h4>
<p>At this live performance, Harding and Sloan, podcasters who typically hold the audience in their minds and interact with them at a distance and asynchronously, are now interacting with their audience in real time. The audience co-presence, visual modality, and live/real-time nature of this event throw Harding and Sloan out of their element.
As they get into the flow of the performance, Harding and Sloan negotiate how to interact with each other and with the audience, and ultimately become more comfortable with the live medium. I focused on a clip near the beginning of the performance, when this negotiation is still tentative. The moments where Harding and Sloan stumble are revealing in terms of how learning to listen is an emergent, social interaction—like a moment during the sing-a-long where Harding loses the beat, starts laughing and looks to the audience to help him get back on track.

<p>Perhaps in the moments where Harding and Sloan rely heavily on their scripts, they are taking on the role of “expert,” explicitly referencing knowledge they hope to relay to the audience.  Alternatively, in the moments where they are reacting in an unscripted way, they are engaging the implicit knowledge they have earned, recalling their practice as learners, and relaying that knowledge in a more informal—and perhaps more relatable—format to the audience.</p>

<h4 class="display-9 fw-bold col-md-8">Sequencing and Structure of Interaction</h4>
<p>I focused on the sing-a-long portion of the performance to explore an assertion: <em>Harding and Sloan attempt to teach a live audience to learn to listen to pop music analytically by stepping them through a structured, mediated sequence of learning activities.</em> This sequence moves from active listening, to embodied collaborative creation (singing), to mediated interpretation (explanation). While we have little access to the audience’s external reactions or internal receptions of this teaching moment, we are able to see how Harding and Sloan respond and adapt, in real time, to the audience. Thus, we can use this scenario to identify patterns of learning to listen that we might emulate in other interactions where the goal is developing analytic listening skills. </p>
