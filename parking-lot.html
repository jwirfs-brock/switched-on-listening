<p class="col-md-8 fs-7"><strong>What techniques can support people as they learn how to listen to sounds analytically?</strong> I explore this question through video analysis of a live performance of <a href="https://switchedonpop.com/"><em>Switched on Pop</em></a>, a podcast that teaches people how to listen closely to music.</p>
<p class="col-md-8 fs-7"><em>Switched on Pop</em> takes the stance that pop music isn't just junk food for your ears; rather, it’s a powerful vehicle to understand musical concepts like song structure and chord progression.
On the podcast, they use a variety of techniques to teach sonic concepts, including: repetition with variation, defining key terms, and reproducing sounds with instruments or their own voices. These techniques might translate to teaching audiences to perceive auditory display and sonification, which, like music, uses the qualities sounds — timbre, tempo, pitch, etc. — to convey meaning.</p>
<p class="col-md-8 fs-7"><strong>Video analysis</strong> enables us to see what close listening looks like and observe how it happens in the whole body, rather than only in the ears and mind. Further, video analysis allows us to consider listening as a sensory-social experience by observing interpersonal acts of listening.
This is especially relevant for the live performance of <em>Switched on Pop</em>, where the hosts and audience can interact with each other.</p>

<div class="collapse" id="scripted" >
<p>At this live performance, Harding and Sloan, podcasters who typically hold the audience in their minds and interact with them at a distance and asynchronously, are now interacting with their audience in real time. The audience co-presence, visual modality, and live/real-time nature of this event throw Harding and Sloan out of their element.
As they get into the flow of the performance, Harding and Sloan negotiate how to interact with each other and with the audience, and ultimately become more comfortable with the live medium. I focused on a clip near the beginning of the performance, when this negotiation is still tentative. The moments where Harding and Sloan stumble are revealing in terms of how learning to listen is an emergent, social interaction—like a moment during the sing-a-long where Harding loses the beat, starts laughing and looks to the audience to help him get back on track.

<p>Perhaps in the moments where Harding and Sloan rely heavily on their scripts, they are taking on the role of “expert,” explicitly referencing knowledge they hope to relay to the audience.  Alternatively, in the moments where they are reacting in an unscripted way, they are engaging the implicit knowledge they have earned, recalling their practice as learners, and relaying that knowledge in a more informal—and perhaps more relatable—format to the audience.</p>

<div class="collapse" id="sequencing" >
<p>I focused on the sing-a-long portion of the performance to explore an assertion: <em>Harding and Sloan attempt to teach a live audience to learn to listen to pop music analytically by stepping them through a structured, mediated sequence of learning activities.</em> This sequence moves from active listening, to embodied collaborative creation (singing), to mediated interpretation (explanation). While we have little access to the audience’s external reactions or internal receptions of this teaching moment, we are able to see how Harding and Sloan respond and adapt, in real time, to the audience. Thus, we can use this scenario to identify patterns of learning to listen that we might emulate in other interactions where the goal is developing analytic listening skills. </p>

<p><small><em>Landscape with labeled sub-sequences:
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
<li>A: [0:00-0:12] A sound clip is playing. Here, Harding and Sloan are modeling active listening through their body movements and their gazes (at the computer, down).</li>
<li>B: [0:12-0:27] Sloan is setting up the sing-a-long by explaining how it will work, gesturing to the portions of the room with his hands, and singing short excerpts with his voice. He is gazing at the audience to establish understanding, but switches to gazing at Harding to synchronize the count-off to start the sing-a-long.</li>
<li>C: [0:27-0:36] Harding, Sloan, and the audience are singing along, performing two different parts of the chorus. Both Harding and Sloan are gazing at the audience, establishing a shared action and timing with them.</li>
<li>D: [0:36-0:45] Debrief of the sing-a-long, where Harding and Sloan banter with each other (and to a lesser extent with the audience), diffuse any lingering tension, and set up for the next segment.</li>
<li>E: [0:45 - 1:27] Sloan is performing an expository/explanatory monologue, where he interprets the meaning of the two-part chorus they all just collectively performed. After a brief set-up of looking at his script, he is looking at the audience to establish a connection with them. Throughout, he uses gestures to emphasize the points he is making.</li>
<li>F: [1:27 - 1:29] Hand-off between Sloan and Harding, transitioning into Harding having the floor.</li></small></em></p>
</small>
<p>This sequence bounces back and forth from demonstration to participation: Harding and Sloan demonstrate listening, while the audience simultaneously participates; next Sloan demonstrates singing, which the audience then mirrors.
Through this toggling between demonstration and participation, suspense is building: Why are we focusing so much on this chorus and what can we learn from it? Finally, that suspense is resolved through Harding’s explanation.
This is one potential pattern, which I am tentatively coding as <em>[ demonstrate | participate | explain ]</em>.

<p>Harding and Sloan also employ other micro-structural actions throughout the performance, such as: defining existing musical terms (this is timbre, this is form, etc.), developing a new vocabulary unique to the event (referring to a fictionalized critic as “competent cheese” and referring back to him over and over), sign-posting (listing the concepts that they are going to learn, then returning to them by name).
Perhaps patterns and sequences like these could be building blocks for auditory display and sonificartion designers as they teach audiences to listen.

<div class="collapse" id="closelistening" >
<p>Video analysis gives us access to gestures, posture, gaze, and other physical, non-verbal cues. In this live performance, when the hosts play music clips from their position on stage, they have nowhere to hide and are forced to remain on stage, remaining an object of visual interest for the audience. This can be awkward. Harding and Sloan diffuse this awkwardness by modeling active listening practices that engage their entire bodies. As they listen, they give the audience something to look at. What does this active listening entail?</p>

<img src="files/not-that-innocent.gif" class="img-fluid">
<p><small><em>  As “Oops!...I Did it Again” plays, both Hading and Sloan have their eyes slightly downcast, as if narrowing their fields of vision so that they can focus on listening. Harding also appears to be looking at his laptop, monitoring how much time is left in the clip. Still, we can see his head nod ever so slightly to the rhythm of the final lines of the chorus (box B). Sloan demonstrates an even more explicit style of embodied listening, enacting the rhythm of the song with his foot, which moves in a circular motion, and his hands, which he raises from the arms of the chair, forms into fists near his lap, thumb on top almost like he is playing the drums. Finally, he pumps his fists up and down, grooving from his shoulders, to punctuate the beats of,  “I’m not that innocent." (box A) In doing so, he is demonstrating that it is perfectly ok, even preferable, to feel the song with his body, signaling to the audience that they can and should do the same. Although we cannot see the entire audience, we can see a few people in the front row, to Sloan’s left, subtly bobbing and swaying (box C) and to Harding’s right nodding (box D).
</em></small></p>

<p>As they listen, Harding and Sloan both use their bodies, but in very different ways: Harding’s bodily movements are subtle, whereas Sloan’s are pronounced. But in both cases, they are normalizing the process of feeling sound with the body and inviting the audience to do the same: By extension, however you feel the sound with your body is ok. We don’t all listen with our bodies in the same way.</p>
